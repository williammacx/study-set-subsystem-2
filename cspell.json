This is a comprehensive, multi-role academic platform designed to centralize student workflows.

The system enables Course Managers to create and manage courses with integrated assignments and resources, while Learners can join courses, track assignments via a personal calendar, and utilize a collaborative Study Set system to create, share, and rate interactive study materials.

The platform also features integrated messaging for course-related discussions and direct communication.
